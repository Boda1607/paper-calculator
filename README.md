## ðŸ§® How It Works

### âž¤ Step-by-step Workflow

1. **Set Your Base Price**  
   Navigate to the **Settings** page and enter a reference width, height, and total price. The app will calculate price per cmÂ² and save it for future use.

2. **Calculate Paper Price**  
   Input the width, height, and quantity of your item in the **Paper Price** section. The app computes total area and pricing, and lets you export an invoice as PDF.

3. **Optimize Base Sheet Layout**  
   In the **Base Sheet** tab, input the full sheet size, gutter spacing, and piece size. It calculates how many pieces fit, used area, waste area, and total cost.

4. **Multi-Item Costing**  
   Use the **Multi-item** section to add various sized items in bulk. Youâ€™ll get the total cost and a breakdown for each item.

5. **Export & Install**  
   Every result section offers a **Print Invoice** button. You can also install the app via the **Download** section following mobile instructions.
